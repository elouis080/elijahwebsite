<h1>Eli's Portfolio</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Elijah Louis (He/Him). I'm an audio engineer based in New York City. <br> I started audio engineering as an amateur when I set out to make music of my own on Logic Pro X. Since then, I have graduated from Laguardia CC with an A.A.S. in audio engineering, <br> fully equipped with professional studio knowledge, digital audio workspace (DAW) software skills, and a keen technical understanding of what artists look for in an engineer. <br> I am familiar with the standard audio engineering console mechanics and can run any engineering session with one. </p>
<p> After exploring the underground music scene, I have come out of the other side with original music posted on streaming services, a solid resume of performed venues, and memories to last a lifetime. But what I've come to enjoy the most is watching a person's eyes light up as I bring their mixing ideas to fruition. Musicians have a vision, and my job is to help them convey that vision clearly, on a sonic level. My goal is to keep one less bad mix out of the ears of the audience, and out of a great artist's discography.</p>
