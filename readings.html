<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>Being new to the technical side of capturing images, to me it equates to novelty. Changing the settings on a camera knowing why I’m  changing those settings feels affirming, like I know exactly what parameters are needed to capture a given image. I’ve always taken images though. For as long as I’ve been alive, cameras, whether they be digital or disposable, have always been available to me. The purpose always being to freeze a moment in time that one may look at as memorable. In her essay, Sontag says that “Each still photograph is a privileged moment, turned into a slim object that one can keep and look at again” (Sontag, 18). Throughout her piece, Sontag asserts the stillness of a captured image, not exclusively physically but chronologically. Photos are precious because of their ability to capture the morality of a given subject. As Sontag says, “All photographs are memento mori” (Sontag, 15), reinforcing this idea of an image’s precious quality. To me, capturing images inadvertently becomes  about adding subjectivity to an objective. Photos are a physical manifestation of differing perspectives; 100 photographers could all take the same exact photo and yet they all come out differently when all is said and done. <br> <br> Perspective can be shared, but I don’t think it can be replicated, except for when taking a photo. You are replicating a literal snapshot of your perspective when aiming and shooting a picture. The resulting photo is unique because your perspective, your vantage point, is unique. In fact, perspective is so unique that it’s quite difficult to get the same photo twice outside of a studio setting, even if you’re the person that took the first photo. To photograph is to capture the elusive, the fleeting. I think there is a level of responsibility one must take when photographing. In this digital age, it is almost impossible to avoid being in the background of someone’s selfie or vlog or TikTok, and that can be reconciled, given this usually occurs in a public space. But, I maintain that we still have to respect people’s desires to be off camera when that request is made. Right now, people represent notions of our world mostly through short form videos and carousel image posts. Oftentimes these videos are posted on Instagram or Tiktok or other social media platforms that allow for quick viewing of these short form videos. Like many of my peers, I could represent the notions of our world as it currently stands through various social media platforms. I could photograph moments of my life and take the opportunity to practice self-expression. I could seek out and photograph moments that could be culturally significant. Given the digital age, I think there are many options for myself and others to choose from to offer a snapshot of our current world. I would like to know what Sontag would have thought of my generation being thrust into the world of producing, having constant and unmonitored internet access and the implications of that access on media today. How our phones have become extremities for some of us, an extension of ourselves, and how our ability to freeze a moment in time at any moment saturates our population’s collection of media. </p>

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>AI has rapidly become a pervasive phenomenon over the past several years. From social media to the classroom, it seems that AI has nestled itself into the population quite seamlessly, and without very much push back (depending on who you ask). Among the younger population, you’ll be met with raving and enthusiasm over this revolutionary technology, an air of excitement follows the description of AI. Among our older demographic, there are shared sentiments of reluctance, weariness, apprehension, and a glaring ignorance to the technology. This leaves our older generations more vulnerable than most when it comes to AI supported phishing scams, political propaganda, and many more risks to keep in mind that can yield real-life consequences. The emergence of AI then only further stresses the importance of media literacy in the digital information age; the more familiarity one has with digital media, the less vulnerable they become to being fooled by AI-generated videos or photos (although even the most chronically online can admit to having been fooled even for a second by AI-generated content). </p>
<p>With each advancement in the AI world, comes more difficulty in our ability to distinguish verifiable content from “AI slop.” This becomes dangerous when people use AI for dishonest and/or malicious purposes. For example, perhaps a political extremist intends to post something inflammatory about a government official or spread a lie, perhaps perpetuate an ideal; content generated to meet this criteria can very easily be obtained in the age of AI and deepfakes, where copying a person’s likeness is about as easy as copying text from a word document. After that, it’s easy to control the narrative in a niche or subgroup of the population as confirmation bias does the rest of the work. Generally, groups like that don’t tend to do further research on things they see online. Thus, a new ideal is born. 
</p>
<p>Back in 1938, before this vast and unfathomably endless landscape of the digital era swept the globe, Orson Welles’ fictional radio broadcast, War of the Worlds, fooled a handful of people. In the digital age, the general population would most likely not be fooled by something like this. And a more advanced media literate population calls for more advanced methods of deception. Despite such advanced media literacy (relative to 1938), AI is still fooling people, and on a much larger scale. </p>
<p>AI also poses a great environmental threat to our planet. There are server farms dedicated solely to the function of AI that are using up insurmountable quantities of water and electricity just so that your average Gen Z or Millennial citizen can have their grocery list written out for them, or a 200-word response completed. The way that AI servers are currently stored, it is not sustainable long-term as we are already seeing adverse effects of their usage. If we can find a way to regulate AI on a political, environmental, and intellectual level, then maybe its cultural influence and potential for technological advancements will be worth considering. However, until that time comes, we need to take a serious look at the way we use our resources.</p>
